# WeGetFit

A community-based fitness app.

V1:
The User will have the ability to post on a message board specific to their interest of exercise.
The User has the ability to signin and view a message board related to exercise meetups.
Unfortunately additional features were unable to be added due to time constraints.

My motivation to build it was to have the ability to meet up with other people to do outdoor fitness.

I am most proud of the design of the website, in particular the modals that make ux more enjoyable.

If I had more time I would integrate maps into each of the thumbnails to share proposed running routes.

Integrating map api was the most difficult part and broke the app so many times that I scrapped it.
